Read the staged changes from diff.txt and write a commit message to commit.md

Use conventional commit format where appropriate, following this structure:

- feat: for new features
- fix: for bug fixes
- docs: for documentation changes
- style: for formatting changes that do not affect code meaning
- refactor: for code restructuring without changing functionality
- test: for adding or modifying tests
- chore: for maintenance tasks, dependency updates, or configuration changes
- perf: for performance improvements
