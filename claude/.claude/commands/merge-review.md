we have merged some new changes into the branch. some tasks may now be complete, paritally complete or need changed.

use a subagent for each @task/. review the current state of the task and compare it to the current codebase. update the status of the task to indicate what work is now complete, what work is partially complete, what work is now irellavant or any new work in the task that might now need implemented. do commit any changes. you should only update the @/task/\*.md for the task your agent is analyzing. ultrathink and do as much work in parallel as possible with sub-agents.
