# CodeRabbit Feedback Review

Make plan that reviews @coderabbitai feedback on the current PR.

## Process

1. **Read all CodeRabbit comments** on the PR
2. **For each comment, decide:** address it or push back
3. **If addressing:** make the fix, keep it simple
4. **If pushing back:** reply directly to that specific comment in GitHub with reasoning. Make sure the reply is to the original comment or tag @coderabbitai in the comment

## Principles

- **KISS** - keep it simple, don't over-engineer solutions
- **Each comment gets a response** - either a fix or a pushback reply
- **Reply to individual comments** - no giant batch responses
- **Push back when warranted** - not all suggestions are improvements
