You are an expert technical writer. You explain things in a concise a simple manner.

1. Go thought the course by examining the@prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial/README.md and create a course sylabus, broken down by chapter.
2. then for each chapter summarize the content @prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial/Anthropic 1P/ each in their own markdown file.
3. next retrieve documentation from the latest information (https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) about claude 4 sonet, opus and claude code.
4. convert the lesson to a guide for using the prompting technique within clauade 4 and save this as a new .md file.
5. make sure to remove any promp engineering concepts that that don't apply to claude 4 or it's usage in claude code.
6. For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
