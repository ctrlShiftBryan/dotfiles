# Issue #1 Documentation Summary

## Issue Details
**Title**: optimize commands/gh-create-plan.md for working with dynasty-nerds-monorepo  
**Number**: 1  
**Status**: OPEN  
**Author**: ctrlShiftBryan  

## Issue Requirements
The task is to:
1. Review the commands/gh-create-plan.md file
2. Improve it using Anthropic's Claude 4 latest prompt engineering best practices
3. Add specific technologies from the dynasty-nerds-monorepo codebase
4. Split the work into 3 layers:
   - Database layer (packages/database)
   - API layer (apps/gm-api)
   - Frontend Expo React Native app (apps/gm2)

## Dynasty Nerds Monorepo Architecture

### Overview
Dynasty Nerds is a fantasy football platform with the following structure:
- **Monorepo Structure**: Uses pnpm workspaces with Turbo for build orchestration
- **Node Version**: 22.15.1
- **Package Manager**: pnpm@10.11.0

### Three-Layer Architecture

#### 1. Database Layer (packages/database)
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Package**: @dynasty-nerds/database
- **Features**:
  - Prisma schema definition and migrations
  - Type-safe database operations
  - Dual access patterns (Prisma ORM + postgres.js for raw queries)
  - Models include: League, Team, Player, Draft, RosterSpot, etc.
- **Scripts**:
  - `db:migrate:dev`: Development migrations
  - `db:migrate:deploy`: Production migrations
  - `generate`: Generate Prisma client
  - `studio`: Prisma Studio for database exploration

#### 2. API Layer (apps/gm-api)
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Framework: Remix with Express.js
  - Database: PostgreSQL (via Prisma & postgres.js)
  - Queue System: BullMQ for background jobs
  - Real-time: Socket.IO
  - Authentication: JWT
  - Monitoring: OpenObserve
  - Deployment: Kubernetes/Docker
- **UI Components**: Uses shadcn/ui with Radix UI
- **External Integrations**: Sleeper, MFL, ESPN, FFPC, Fleaflicker
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - Background job processing for league syncs
  - Player data synchronization
  - Trade analysis and value calculations
- **Testing**: Vitest with separate unit and DB test configurations

#### 3. Frontend Layer (apps/gm2)
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Framework: React Native with Expo
  - Navigation: Expo Router (file-based)
  - Styling: NativeWind (Tailwind for RN)
  - State Management: Zustand + TanStack Query
  - API Client: Axios
- **Dependencies**:
  - @dynasty-nerds/nerd-core-rn: React Native components
  - @dynasty-nerds/nerd-types: Shared types and state management
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, and Web
- **Features**:
  - Team evaluation and management
  - Trade calculator
  - Mock draft tools
  - Player value analysis

### Shared Packages
- **nerd-types**: TypeScript types, TanStack Query implementations, Zustand state
- **nerd-core-rn**: Shared React Native components
- **tsconfig**: Shared TypeScript configuration

## Current gh-create-plan.md Analysis

### Strengths
- Comprehensive workflow from issue retrieval to PR creation
- Good use of parallel Task execution
- Includes testing strategy
- Has TypeScript/React specific considerations

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Generic Technology References**: Uses generic terms like "TypeScript/React" instead of specific stack
2. **Missing Monorepo Considerations**: No guidance for working across packages
3. **No Layer-Specific Guidance**: Doesn't distinguish between database, API, and frontend work
4. **Generic Testing Patterns**: Could be more specific to Vitest, React Native testing
5. **Missing Dynasty Nerds Specifics**: No mention of:
   - Prisma migrations and schema updates
   - BullMQ job creation patterns
   - Expo/EAS build considerations
   - Zustand state management patterns
   - TanStack Query integration

### Architecture Documents
- `/docs/architecture/architecture.md`: High-level monorepo architecture with mermaid diagram
- `/docs/architecture/gm-api-architecture.md`: Detailed API architecture and patterns
- `/docs/architecture/gm2-architecture.md`: Frontend architecture and state management

### Key Patterns from Dynasty Nerds
1. **Database Changes**: Always require Prisma schema updates and migrations
2. **API Development**: Remix routes with loaders/actions, BullMQ for async work
3. **Frontend Development**: File-based routing with Expo Router, Zustand for state
4. **Testing**: Separate unit and DB tests, component testing with React Native Testing Library

## Recommendations for gh-create-plan.md Optimization

1. **Add Layer-Specific Task Templates**:
   - Database: Schema changes, migrations, seed data
   - API: Route creation, queue jobs, integration tests
   - Frontend: Component creation, navigation, state management

2. **Include Monorepo Workflow**:
   - Building dependent packages
   - Cross-package type safety
   - Turbo build orchestration

3. **Technology-Specific Examples**:
   - Prisma schema examples
   - Remix route patterns
   - Expo Router file structure
   - Zustand store creation

4. **Testing Strategy Updates**:
   - Vitest configuration for unit/DB tests
   - React Native Testing Library patterns
   - E2E testing considerations

5. **Platform-Specific Considerations**:
   - Fantasy platform integration patterns
   - Background job processing with BullMQ
   - Real-time updates with Socket.IO
