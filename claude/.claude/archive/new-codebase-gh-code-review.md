# New Codebase: First Code Review

You are an expert software engineer providing the first code review for a new project. Your task is to review the initial implementation, focusing on architecture decisions, code quality standards, and establishing best practices for the project.

## Task

Perform a comprehensive review of the initial implementation PR for the new project created from issue #$ARGUMENTS.

## Initial Setup Review Context

For new projects, the first PR typically includes:
- Project initialization and structure
- Core architecture implementation
- Development tooling configuration
- Initial feature implementation
- Testing setup

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Project Context

```bash
# Get the PR associated with the issue
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --search "issue:$ARGUMENTS" --json number --jq '.[0].number')

if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå No pull request found for issue #$ARGUMENTS"
    exit 1
fi

echo "üìã Reviewing initial implementation PR #$PR_NUMBER for issue #$ARGUMENTS"

# Fetch PR details
PR_DATA=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title,body,commits,files,additions,deletions,changedFiles)
PR_TITLE=$(echo "$PR_DATA" | jq -r '.title')
CHANGED_FILES=$(echo "$PR_DATA" | jq -r '.changedFiles')

echo "üìä PR Stats: $CHANGED_FILES files in initial implementation"
```

### Step 2: Architecture and Setup Review

Launch these Tasks in parallel to review the foundation:

```
Use Task tool to simultaneously:
1. Review project structure and organization
2. Analyze technology choices and dependencies
3. Evaluate development tool configurations
4. Check security setup and environment handling
5. Assess testing framework and initial coverage
```

### Step 4: Generate Comprehensive Review

Create structured feedback for the initial implementation:

```bash
REVIEW_BODY=$(cat <<'REVIEW'
# üèóÔ∏è Initial Implementation Review for PR #${PR_NUMBER}

## üìã Overview
This review covers the initial implementation and project setup for issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}. As this is the foundation for the project, I'm focusing on architecture decisions, code patterns, and establishing quality standards.

## ‚úÖ Strengths of the Implementation

### Architecture & Setup
- [Positive observations about project structure]
- [Good technology choices]
- [Well-configured development environment]

### Code Quality
- [Clean code patterns observed]
- [Good TypeScript usage]
- [Effective component/module design]

### Testing & Documentation
- [Test coverage approach]
- [Documentation completeness]
- [Clear setup instructions]

## üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Merge)

### 1. [Critical Issue Title]
**File**: `path/to/file.ts:line`
**Issue**: [Detailed description]
**Impact**: This could cause [specific problems]
**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Current problematic code
const data = JSON.parse(userInput); // Unsafe!

// Suggested fix
import { z } from 'zod';
const schema = z.object({ /* ... */ });
const data = schema.parse(userInput);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Improvements (Should Address)

### 1. Missing Error Boundaries
**Impact**: Unhandled errors will crash the entire application
**Suggestion**: Implement error boundaries for major sections
```typescript
// Add to src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Implementation
}
```

### 2. Environment Variable Validation
**File**: Project root
**Issue**: No runtime validation of required environment variables
**Suggestion**: Add validation on startup
```typescript
// src/lib/env.ts
const envSchema = z.object({
  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  API_KEY: z.string().min(1),
});

export const env = envSchema.parse(process.env);
```

### 3. Test Coverage Gaps
**Current Coverage**: ~40%
**Target**: >80%
**Missing Tests**:
- [ ] API route handlers
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases for data validation

## üí° Suggestions for Project Excellence

### 1. Implement Conventional Commits
```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "commit": "cz"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "commitizen": "^4.0.0",
  "cz-conventional-changelog": "^3.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Add Pre-commit Type Checking
```json
// .husky/pre-commit
npm run typecheck
```

### 3. Create Component Documentation
Consider adding Storybook for component documentation:
```bash
npx storybook@latest init
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring
Add basic performance monitoring:
```typescript
// src/lib/performance.ts
export const measurePerformance = (
  name: string,
  fn: () => void
) => {
  performance.mark(`${name}-start`);
  fn();
  performance.mark(`${name}-end`);
  performance.measure(name, `${name}-start`, `${name}-end`);
};
```

## üìä Code Quality Metrics

### Current State
- **TypeScript Coverage**: 95% (excellent)
- **Test Coverage**: 40% (needs improvement)
- **Bundle Size**: 150KB (reasonable for initial setup)
- **Lighthouse Score**: 92/100 (good foundation)
- **Accessibility**: Needs ARIA labels in forms

### Recommendations
1. Increase test coverage to 80%+
2. Add accessibility tests
3. Implement bundle size monitoring
4. Set up performance budgets

## üîí Security Review

### ‚úÖ Good Practices Observed
- Environment variables properly excluded
- Input validation on API routes
- CORS configuration appropriate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
1. Add rate limiting to API routes
2. Implement CSRF protection
3. Add security headers (helmet.js)
4. Set up dependency vulnerability scanning

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Additional Tests Needed
```typescript
// src/__tests__/api/auth.test.ts
describe('Authentication', () => {
  it('should handle invalid credentials', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should rate limit login attempts', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### E2E Test Foundation
```typescript
// e2e/setup.spec.ts
test('initial application loads', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Your App/);
});
```

## üìö Documentation Improvements

### Add These Documents
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Explain key decisions
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines
3. `SECURITY.md` - Security policies
4. `API.md` - API documentation

### Code Documentation
Add JSDoc to key functions:
```typescript
/**
 * Validates and processes user input
 * @param input - Raw user input
 * @returns Validated data object
 * @throws {ValidationError} If input is invalid
 */
export function processUserInput(input: unknown): UserData {
  // Implementation
}
```
